# DarkNightsRising
A simple, text-based adventure game with TTS. Aims to be playable on any Linux distribution, with minimal dependencies.

The entire thing is written in shell script, and the game works together as a family of shell scripts. 
Variables that need to be called through different scripts are done through a automatically generated "variables.txt" file. 

Dark Nights Rising is going to be about isolation and how the feeling of loneliness can pervade your mind. The player aims to escape this situation through a series of fantasy scenarios that are affected by choices the player makes as the game goes on. 

I would eventually like to make an accompanying soundtrack for this little game. 
Dark Nights Rising is free and open-source software licensed under the MIT license, and you can feel free to help make it better by contributing. 

I would eventually like to make this something fun to play on Linux desktops and Linux phones, regardless of which distro they are running on.
