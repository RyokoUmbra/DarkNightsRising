# Dark Nights Rising Library 

This file lives here to describe the Library and its purpose. 

Certain .txt documents will get saved to this folder by Dark Nights Rising to source pieces of data from. 

You can delete it, but it will cause issues in the game and will be automatically regenerated at certain points in the game.

If its presence offends you, simply delete the /library folder anytime you find it auto-generated.
